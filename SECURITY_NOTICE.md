## ‚úÖ Actions Taken
- [x] Removed credentials from documentation files
- [x] Replaced with placeholder values
- [x] Verified .gitignore is properly configured
- [x] Added security warnings to example files

## üî¥ URGENT ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Rotate MongoDB Credentials (HIGH PRIORITY)
```bash
# In MongoDB Atlas Dashboard:
1. Go to Database Access
2. Delete user 'aditya_db_user'
3. Create new user with different credentials
4. Update production environment variables
```

### 2. Review Google Service Account Access
```bash
# In Google Cloud Console:
1. Check service account permissions
2. Consider rotating service account key
3. Review Calendar and Sheets access logs
```

### 3. Update Production Environment Variables
- Update Render backend environment variables
- Update any other deployment platforms
- Verify new credentials work in production

### 4. Security Audit
- Review commit history for other potential exposures
- Consider using tools like `git-secrets` or `truffleHog`
- Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent future exposures

## Prevention Measures
1. **Never commit real credentials** - Always use placeholder values in example files
2. **Use environment variables** - Keep all secrets in `.env` files (gitignored)
3. **Regular security audits** - Scan for accidentally committed secrets
4. **Pre-commit hooks** - Automatically detect secrets before commits

## Files Affected
- `backend/RENDER_ENV_SETUP.md` ‚úÖ Fixed
- `backend/.env.example` ‚úÖ Fixed
- `backend/.env` ‚ö†Ô∏è Contains real credentials (gitignored)

## Contact
If you have any questions about this security incident, please contact the development team immediately.
